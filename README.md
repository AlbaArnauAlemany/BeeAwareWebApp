### Pollenic Allergy Monitoring Platform
Allergies affect a large portion of the population, and their symptoms can be
exacerbated by various environmental factors, including weather conditions.
The platform's goal is to provide users with a channel for information on
high-risk periods based on daily pollen forecasts to help them anticipate
potential symptoms. Additionally, it will allow users to log their perceived
symptoms daily on a subjective scale so they can compare these symptoms with
the pollen load index. Users can also record days when an antihistamine was
taken to observe its impact on symptoms. All this information will be grouped
in a graph, providing users a simple and effective visualization tool to review
their personal history, helping them act accordingly or discuss with a healthcare
professional. The platform will rely on a Google Pollen API for pollen load
forecasts to retrieve pollen indices based on the user's specified location.
